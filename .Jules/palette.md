## 2024-06-25 - Password Visibility Toggle
**Learning:** Users often struggle with password inputs, especially on mobile or when creating complex passwords. Masking characters by default without a toggle option increases error rates and frustration.
**Action:** Always include a "Show/Hide Password" toggle button within password input fields to allow users to verify their input before submitting. Ensure it is keyboard accessible and uses ARIA labels.
